Implementation of View Morph Algorithm in Python.  Based on Matlab implementation.
Uses numpy 1.6.2 and opencv-python 2.4.3

Currently does not work properly.  
Basic conversion of matlab code to python is done, however, still needs grounding points for overlay of image between two
warps.  As of now the two warped images cannot overlay properly.
